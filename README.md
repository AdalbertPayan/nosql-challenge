Module 12 Challenge

Graders:
All code was derived in one way or another from Module 12 and lecutures excluding the pprint portions, I had trouble with displaying the first 10 results; ie: 
pprint(hygiene_zero_scored[0:10]). 
On this portion I had to ask ChatGPT for hlep as the .head() was not working for some reason.

Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
